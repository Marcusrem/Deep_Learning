# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of deep learning experiments and my first attempt at replicating a published research paper.  
All work was developed and tested using Google Colab.

## Contents
- 📘 **Paper Replication:** A step-by-step implementation based on the original research  
- 🧪 **Colab Notebooks:** Reproducible deep learning experiments  
- 📄 **Supporting Files:** Data, notes, and results
